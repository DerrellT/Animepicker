I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Python and the Tkinter library for selecting anime based on specific criteria. The app allows users to choose the genre, length, and type of anime, providing a dynamic way to explore and display relevant anime titles. 
Technologies Used: Python, Tkinter (GUI library), Pandas (Data manipulation)
